### Installation and usage instructions

Please note that we do **not** officially support installations using mod management software, nor do we support installations from sources other than our official GitHub.

**Read the instructions carefully.**

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModOutfits/releases): select the ZIP file starting with `jn`.
2. Extract/unzip the release.
3. For each outfit/set you wish to add to the game, go into the folder for that outfit and copy the contents to your JN installation (under the main `DDLC` folder).
4. Launch `DDLC.exe`, or `DDLC.sh` if you are on Linux/Mac: if Natsuki does not bring up custom outfits, you may ask her to search for them directly under `Talk` -> `About your outfit...` -> `Can you search again for new outfits?`.

### Troubleshooting

Please refer to the guidance on the official JN wiki [here](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModDev/wiki/06:-Custom-clothing-and-outfitting-guide-(Spoilers)).
